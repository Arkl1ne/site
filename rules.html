                        <h2>3. Terms of the agreement.</h2>
                        <p>
                            3.1 These rules are considered to be organized due to the terms of the public offer, which
                            is formed at the time the Customer submits an application and is one of the main components
                            of this agreement. A public offer is the information displayed by the contractor about the
                            conditions for submitting an application. The main components of the public offer are the
                            actions taken at the end of the application by the Customer and talking about his exact
                            intentions to make a deal on the terms proposed by the Contractor before completing this
                            application. The time, date, and parameters of the application are created by the Contractor
                            automatically at the time of completion of the formation of this application. The offer must
                            be accepted by the Customer within 24 hours from the end of the formation of the
                            application. The Service Agreement shall enter into force upon receipt of the title units in
                            the full amount specified in the application from the Customer to the details of the
                            Contractor. Operations with title units are accounted for in accordance with the rules,
                            regulations and format of electronic settlement systems. The contract is valid for a period,
                            which is established from the moment of filing an application until termination at the
                            initiative of one of the parties.
                        </p>
                        <h2>4. Subject of the agreement.</h2>
                        <p>
                            4.1. By using technical methods, the Contractor undertakes to carry out the exchange of
                            title units for a commission from the Customer, after the submission of an application by
                            this person and does this by selling title units to persons who wish to purchase them for an
                            amount indicated not lower than in the application submitted by the Customer. The Contractor
                            undertakes to transfer funds to the details specified by the Customer. In the event of a
                            profit during the exchange, it remains on the Contractor's account as an additional benefit
                            and a premium for commission services.
                        </p>
                        <h2>5. In addition.</h2>
                        <p>
                            5.1. If the Contractor's account receives an amount that differs from that specified in the
                            application, the Contractor makes a recalculation that corresponds to the actual receipt of
                            title units. If this amount exceeds the amount indicated in the application by more than
                            10%, the Contractor terminates the contract unilaterally and all funds are returned to the
                            details of the Customer, taking into account the amount deducted for commission costs during
                            the transfer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.2. In the event that the title units are not sent by the Contractor to the specified
                            details of the Customer within 24 hours, the Customer has the full right to demand
                            termination of the agreement and cancel his application, thereby returning the title units
                            to his account in full. An application for termination of the agreement and return of title
                            units is carried out by the Contractor in the event that the funds have not yet been
                            transferred to the specified details of the Customer. In case of cancellation of the
                            contract, the return of the electronic currency is made within 24 hours from the receipt of
                            the request to terminate the contract. If delays in the return occurred through no fault of
                            the Contractor, he is not responsible for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.3. If the title units are not received from the Customer to the account of the Contractor
                            within the specified period, from the moment the application is submitted by the Customer,
                            the agreement between the parties is terminated by the Contractor on the one hand, since the
                            contract does not enter into force. The customer may not be notified about this. If the
                            title units arrive at the details of the Contractor after the specified period, then such
                            funds are transferred back to the Customer's account, and all commission costs associated
                            with the transfer are deducted from these funds. \
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.4. If there is a delay in the transfer of funds to the details specified by the Customer,
                            due to the fault of the settlement system, the Contractor shall not be liable for damage
                            resulting from the long receipt of funds. In this case, the Customer must agree that all
                            claims will be made against the settlement system, and the Contractor shall provide its
                            assistance to the best of its ability within the law.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.5. In the event that a fake of communication flows is detected or an impact is exerted in
                            order to worsen the work of the Contractor, namely its program code, the application is
                            suspended, and the transferred funds are subject to recalculation in accordance with the
                            current agreement. If the Customer does not agree with the recalculation, he has the full
                            right to terminate the contract and the title units will be sent to the details specified by
                            the Customer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.6. In the case of using the services of the Contractor, the Customer fully agrees that the
                            Contractor bears limited liability in accordance with the scope of these rules for the
                            received title units and does not give additional guarantees to the Customer, and also does
                            not bear additional responsibility to him. Accordingly, the Customer does not bear
                            additional responsibility to the Contractor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.7. The Customer undertakes to comply with the norms corresponding to the law, as well as
                            not to fake communication flows and not create obstacles for the normal operation of the
                            Contractor's program code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5.8. The Contractor shall not be liable for damages and consequences in the event of an
                            erroneous transfer of electronic currency in the event that the Customer indicated incorrect
                            details when submitting an application.
